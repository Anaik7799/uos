# Gleam harness operational boundary

Contract: SC-HARNESS-MCP-001. Timestamp basis: 2026-09-09T05:19:29Z Gleam MCP heartbeat. Tags: #fractal-l0 #fractal-l3 #fractal-l4 #fractal-l9 #zk-adr #zero-muda

All agent operational work MUST enter the Gleam/OTP harness via MCP or admitted Zenoh ingress. Gleam owns the agent, policy, clock/check verdicts and backend selection; native services stay behind the harness. Development owns edits/builds/tests. Production requires its own admitted release and fenced state. Sa-plan remains the sole task authority; the aggregate OpenRouter budget is USD 10 per UTC day.

Follow the [canonical contract](http://nas-1.tail55d152.ts.net:4100/files/contracts/rules/20260909-0412-gleam-harness-agent-operation-contract.md) and [formal specification](http://nas-1.tail55d152.ts.net:4100/files/docs/design/20260909-0412-gleam-harness-symbiosis-formal-spec.md). The conversation's explicit one-time bootstrap approval is limited to repairing and verifying this interface; it grants no system admission. Rule presence is not runtime bypass enforcement. This operator boundary takes precedence over older imported automation guidance.

## Comprehensive verification checklist

Checks below are obligations, not blanket passing claims.

<details>
<summary>Domain 1 — Metadata, timestamp and Tailscale navigation</summary>

- [ ] **CHK-01-TIME** — Observe synchronized clock evidence and document prefix.
- [ ] **CHK-02-TAIL** — Verify full Tailnet links and actual serving status.
- [ ] **CHK-03-FRACT** — Verify L0–L9 tags and applicable layer mapping.
- [ ] **CHK-04-KM** — Reconcile specification, wiki, ZK and journal links.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Domain 2 — Zero-Muda purity and storage safety</summary>

- [ ] **CHK-05-MUDA** — Verify exclusions against the candidate dependencies.
- [ ] **CHK-06-GRAPH** — Verify the pure BEAM/Hermes graph boundary.
- [ ] **CHK-07-DRIVE** — Preserve the denied OS serial and test real interlocks only in scope.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Domain 3 — Testing Gold Standard and mathematical gates</summary>

- [ ] **CHK-08-C1C8** — Verify all applicable C1–C8 surfaces.
- [ ] **CHK-09-MATH** — Measure the four declared mathematical gates.
- [ ] **CHK-10-9MOD** — Apply relevant unit, system, TDD, BDD, performance, scalability, property, fuzz and chaos checks.
- [ ] **CHK-11-REGR** — Run applicable regressions and bounded observation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Domain 4 — Cross-language control and observability</summary>

- [ ] **CHK-12-GLEAM** — Observe actual OTP control/supervision behavior.
- [ ] **CHK-13-HERMES** — Observe bounded analysis and authoritative evidence.
- [ ] **CHK-14-ZIGVM** — Verify deterministic execution and descriptor-relative VFS.
- [ ] **CHK-15-MAX** — Observe actual isolated inference when applicable.
- [ ] **CHK-16-OTEL** — Verify clock and nonzero trace/span identity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Domain 5 — Sovereign governance and standalone Jujutsu</summary>

- [ ] **CHK-17-SOV** — Obtain candidate-bound independent review and authorized admission.
- [ ] **CHK-18-JJ** — Preserve standalone JJ, source ownership and exact candidate identity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Domain 6 — Provenance extension</summary>

EV ceiling remains 93. EV-94..109 remain NOT_ADMITTED. No new EV number is minted.
